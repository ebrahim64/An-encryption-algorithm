A System of Encryption Algorithms





## About Project
An encryption algorithm is a formula or procedure that converts a plaintext message into an encrypted ciphertext. Modern algorithms use advanced mathematics and one or more encryption keys to make it relatively easy to encrypt a message but virtually impossible to decrypt it without knowing the keys. Algorithms generally require a source of randomness. They may also involve multiple layers of encryption, repeated permutation, and insertion of sequential one-time values to prevent attacks.
